MailPet
-------

It's a cute little application script aimed at providing an advanced yet flexible CLI-based interface to PHPMailer email sending library, for sending emails using PHPMailer's implementation of SMTP protocol.

It doesn't just provide an implementation of the PHPMailer library, but also enhancements for SMTP configuration discovery along side other features with the hope of making email sending a more pleasant, pet-like experience for CLI pioneers.

Currently the only supported authentication methods are the ones relying on username/password credentials such as: LOGIN/PLAIN, this could be unpleasant for OAUTH users.

Also, no support is provided for MS-Exchange Auto-discovery facilities.

We are planning to cover more authentication methods as well as adding more support for other configuration discovery settings.


Requirements
------------

MailPet is written using PHP programming language, therefore it requires certain set of requirements to be fullfiled prior to its use.

* php-imap (optional, or if mailparse is not available)
